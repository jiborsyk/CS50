    <h1>Were They Telling The Trrrrrruth?</h1>
    <p>Across the world, humans at the very dawns of their civilization
      have told eerily similar origin stories. Stories of an ancient flood, stories of
    an advanced, earlier civilization that had come before them, and provided the seeds
  to their own civilizations. Were these ancient civiliztions, the Sumerians, Egyptians,
  and Maya/Olmec truthful in their recounts? How much of myth is rooted in reality?
    </p>
      <p>
         Why was 11,600-12,800 years ago such an important period in human history?
       </p>
      <p>
        In recent decades, irrefutable evidence has accumulated which challenges the mainstream
        accepted story for the genesis of human civilization. New evidence suggests that the
        biblical flood likely <i> did </i> happen, and there likely <i> was </i> an advanced
      civilization that existed before the cataclysmic flood.
