        <p><b>Across the world, humans at the very dawns of their civilization
          have told eerily similar origin stories. Stories of an ancient flood, stories of
          an advanced, earlier civilization that had come before them, and provided the seeds
          to their own civilizations. Were these ancient civiliztions, the Sumerians, Egyptians,
          and Maya/Olmec truthful in their recounts? How much of myth is rooted in reality? </b>

          <b>In recent decades, irrefutable evidence has accumulated which challenges the mainstream
          accepted story for the genesis of human civilization. New evidence suggests that the
          biblical flood likely <i> did </i> happen, and there likely <i> was </i> an advanced
          civilization that existed before the cataclysmic flood.</b>
